# MinecraftDecompiler

This decompiler should work for any version as long as its mappings are available (a printed message with the url is given for manual check), its wip (for now only decompiling and class name renaming is done).

The Srg mappings were kindly provided by skyrising: https://github.com/skyrising/mc-data (its under CC0: https://github.com/skyrising/mc-deobfuscator/blob/02ba679d42000f43cfd74639d74681192bcdb138/base-data/LICENSE.md)

Run "run.bat" or `python decompiler.py` in shell (you will need python 3.6+, ok lets say 3.7 to be sure)
You will need ofc, java jre and jdk (8 is fine) and the version .jar installed either in the regular windows directory (%appdata%/.minecraft/versions/1.13.1/1.13.1.jar and so on)
